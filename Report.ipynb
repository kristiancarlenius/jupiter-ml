    "in ports only the port latitiude and logitude is usfull. Schedual is to sparse to be usfull but when combined with the training etaRaw and port longitude and latitude, we simply choose the schedual time and x, y coordinates and when not pressent we replace it with etaRaw and port x and y. Most of the columns are to sparse for them to be usfull to the model as you can see under, but from vessel we get vessleType, breadth, length, yearBuilt, CEU, DWT, GT. From ais_test we copy over from ais_train the last row value for each vesselId whitch allows for data pressent in the training set to be pressent in the test set. Here only cog and heading is used as they are only with enought data pressent and with a great egnough range, in contrast rot has more than half of the values missing and sog has an extreamly low variance, even when combining with maxSpeed to calculate a new maxSpeed using the sog I still had almost no effective weighing of the prediction model. All columns not discussed are disgarded for either one of these reasons.\n",

    "In this project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was crucial for understanding the data's structure, quality, and feature relationships. Initially, we examined domain knowledge to identify relevant vessel and maritime factors that could impact prediction accuracy. This knowledge highlighted the importance of specific features, including vesselType, portLatitude, portLongitude, sog, cog, and heading. A check for data intuition followed, where we verified if values appeared reasonable in their contexts; for instance, latitude and longitude values were confirmed to align with known port coordinates, and yearBuilt values were reviewed to ensure they fit within plausible ranges, specifically between 1985 and 2022.\n",

    "Exploring individual features provided insights into their distributions and flagged anomalies, with significant findings in features like cog and heading. We observed a wide variation in cog (course over ground), indicating that it could hold predictive value. In contrast, features like rot and sog displayed high levels of missing data or low variance, limiting their utility for modeling. Further, we examined relationships between features, focusing on potential correlations and predictive interactions among key variables. Specifically, examining pairwise relationships between sog and maxSpeed and between cog and heading helped uncover underlying patterns. Visualizations of portLatitude and portLongitude against other variables supported location data accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we cleaned the dataset by removing sparse and low-variance features, which primarily included rot, fuel, homePort, and others that contributed minimal predictive information due to excessive missing values. This cleaning step optimized our dataset for model training, reducing noise and improving prediction quality."

    "Feature engineering was applied to enhance predictive accuracy by refining and transforming the dataset. Sparse features were carefully evaluated and removed if they exceeded a 50% missing data threshold or displayed low variance, as seen with rot, sog, and homePort. This selective approach minimized irrelevant data while preserving the dimensionality needed for effective predictions. We also employed feature extraction techniques to improve the data's representation. For example, combining portLatitude and portLongitude created a single feature set for port locations, ensuring consistent representations across the dataset. Missing data in these location fields were filled using nearby or median values, providing completeness in the location data used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time features were similarly transformed, where scheduling data from ETA (etaRaw) supplemented sparse fields. New scheduling features (hour_sch, minute_sch, day_sch, month_sch) were created to capture the temporal aspects of ship arrivals and departures, with missing values filled by median values as needed. Adjustments to cog and heading were also made using custom functions (fixcog and fixhead) to ensure consistency in these core navigation metrics, which aided the model’s interpretation of directional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in critical vessel characteristics were addressed through median and mode imputation. Core fields such as vesselType, yearBuilt, length, breadth, CEU, DWT, and GT received this treatment to preserve important ship attributes, filling gaps where data was sparse. This series of feature engineering transformations significantly improved the data quality and its utility for predictive modeling."

    "To select the best model for prediction, we tested a range of algorithms, assessing each one’s accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for handling the dataset's structure. The final model choice was the result of this rigorous comparison. ExtraTreeRegressor emerged as the top-performing model, handling sparse features effectively and achieving the highest accuracy through its ability to optimally partition features. The RandomForestRegressor showed comparable results but was marginally less efficient than ExtraTree, though it still demonstrated robustness with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost yielded moderate predictive results but required substantial computational resources, especially due to the large number of population trees needed for optimum performance. This demand limited its practicality for rapid testing and model iteration. The KNeighborsRegressor performed adequately at an optimal parameter of n=10, but it fell short of meeting the desired performance goals, as proximity-based weighting proved insufficient for robust prediction in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLPRegressor, though incorporating dense layers, faced limitations in performance due to the lack of GPU acceleration. A TensorFlow-based neural network model encountered similar restrictions, with high computational demands and long training times hampering its utility in the model selection process. Ultimately, the ExtraTreeRegressor was selected for the final model due to its superior accuracy and efficiency. A comparative analysis of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) further confirmed the ExtraTreeRegressor’s advantage over the other models."

Feature importance analysis revealed which variables were most influential, with cog, heading, vesselType, CEU, and length standing out as key contributors. A bar plot illustrating the feature importance scores confirmed the weight of these factors in shaping the model’s predictions, emphasizing the importance of vessel characteristics for accurate predictions.\n",

To delve deeper into individual predictions, SHAP values provided local interpretability by explaining each feature’s effect on the model’s output. Analysis with SHAP revealed consistent directional impacts of cog and heading, while features such as vesselType and yearBuilt influenced predictions differently depending on their specific values. SHAP summary plots visually demonstrated each feature’s contribution, offering transparency in the model’s decision-making.\n",
